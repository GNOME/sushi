Bugs:
- things don't work well over remote mounts yet

New plugins:
- Text files
- HTML viewer
- Source code

Ideas:

- make preview window resizable, and save per-file preview size
  in gvfs metadata
- save/share cover art with Rhythmbox/Banshee?
- add a zoom-in/zoom-out effect when opening/closing
