- add a plugin for folders
- add all mimetypes supported by gstreamer for audio/video
- integrate it with Nautilus
- make sure there's a way to raise the window, or that it stays always on top
  (basically test that transient works).

  in gvfs metadata
- add a zoom-in/zoom-out effect when opening/closing
